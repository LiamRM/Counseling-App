# Counseling Application
This application is primarily meant as a tool for guidance counsellors to more easily organize their case notes on their students. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

To install the Counselling Application: 
1. Go to the 'Releases' pane on the right side. 
2. Download the latest 'CounselingApplication.jar' file.
3. Simply move the application to somewhere easily accessible (like your desktop) and open the file. Voila!

If you are having any issues with getting the '.jar' file to run, you likely have to download the latest version of [Java Oracle.](https://java.com/en/download/)

## Built With
